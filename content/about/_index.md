title: About
---

I'm a data scientist and I've worked across the entire spectrum from technology - building complex data models, designing/developing/prototyping analytics applications, analyzing and visualizing data â€“ to people where i've worked with business executives and stakeholders to recommend and implement data driven insights. 

I love using data to answer interesting questions and communicate the results
in diverse audiences. This blog is built with blogdown and Hugo, and deployed using Netlify.
